/**
 * A subscriber that is intended for use with an Observable that does not emit any items. A common use case for this
 * is inserting data into the database. When inserting rows into Cassandra for example, the driver returns a result set
 * which has no rows. In general we are only interested in whether or not the query completed successfully. Upon
 * completion of the insert request, {@link #onCompleted()} will be invoked. If there is an time out or other error
 * performing the operation, then {@link #onError(Throwable)} is invoked.
